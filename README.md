# Learning Django
I am building a personal portfolio website using Django. Built this repository while listening to "Build 3 stunning websites, learn Back and Front End Web Development, deploy your site with HTML5, CSS3 and Bootstrap 4" Udemy course.

The idea is to leverage current Python skills to venture into different areas. Once I get up to speed, I will try to build something a little bit more sophisticated to showcase data sciene works.
